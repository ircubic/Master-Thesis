\chapter*{Prerequisites (OPTIONAL)}
This is from the thesis of Linda Kjeldsen: Because the problems that
this thesis deals with cover so many different aspects of computer
science, it is not possible to go into every little detail of all
the subjects that are mentioned. Consequently, it is assumed that
the reader already has knowledge at the same level as a third year
student of computer science. The reader should have basic knowledge
of the construction of and search algorithms for data structures
like binary trees, heaps and arrays. He or she should also be
familiar with basic analysis concepts like big-O notation, and the
difference between worst case and average case complexity. However,
in case there still are unclarities, a glossary can be found in
Appendix A, introducing most of the important terms used in this
thesis.
