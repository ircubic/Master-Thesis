An abstract is a brief summarizing statement, usually between 75 and
150 words long. It gives the reader a synopsis of the problem,
method, results, and conclusions of your document. The abstract
takes the form of a paragraph, usually with 5-10 sentences.
Abstracts are often collected into volumes and must be able to stand
alone. They are read by parties who are trying to decide whether or
not to read the main document. Sometimes they are read by people who
want to get the big picture before reading the main document.
Abstracts can save readers an immense amount of time.
