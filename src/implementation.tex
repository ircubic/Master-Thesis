\chapter{Implementation (You may use a more specific title in your report)}
\label{implement} Present the implementation, with emphasis on the
more challenging parts. Remember that you do not need to implement
the design to the full extent.

Source code listings often occur in the implementation part of a
report:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=trbl]
1. Recursive procedure, starting at v = root. 2. Search(v,R)
    a. If v is a leaf, then report the point stored in v if it lies in R
    b. Otherwise, if Reg(v) is contained in R, report all points in the
    subtree of v
    c. Otherwise:
        i. If Reg(left(v)) intersects R, then Search(left(v),R)
        ii. If Reg(right(v)) intersects R, then Search(right(v),R)
\end{lstlisting}
