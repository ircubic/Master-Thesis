\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
An acknowledgments section is sometimes included in the front matter
of a longer report, thesis, or collection to note the assistance of
people whose help was crucial but not extensive enough to warrant
their being listed as co-authors. Thesis advisors, technicians, and
colleagues who gave advice or time are all candidates for the
acknowledgments section.
