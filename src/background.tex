\chapter{Background}
\label{rel}

Provide enough information in a technical document to allow your
reader to understand the specific problem being addressed and to
provide a context for your own document. This background information
may include (1) a historical summary of the problem being addressed;
(2) a brief summary of previous work on the topic, including, if
appropriate, relevant theory; and (3) the specific reasons the
document is being written.

In short documents, include background information in the
introduction. In longer documents, however, putting some or all of
the background information in a separate section with a heading may
be more effective. Long and fairly complex reports, especially
experimental reports where the purpose of the document is to verify,
evaluate, illustrate, or apply one or more theories, often include a
separate theory section.
